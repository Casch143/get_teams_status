<h1>
  GET_TEAMS_STATUS
</h1>

A handy little piece of python code that sniffs your Microsoft Teams logs.txt for the latest status update and returns it as:  
"Available" = Available  
"Busy" = Busy  
"BRB" = Be Right Back  
"DND" = Do Not Disturb  
"Presenting" = Presenting  
"IAM" = In A Meeting  
"Offline" = Offline  
  
It takes one argument, a string with the path to the teams AppData folder. It looks something like:
C:/Users/XXXXXXX/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Teams  
  
This code is issued under the free-for-all to use principle.
However if you work for a large company that plan to use it, you should hit me up and pay something. Come-on..  
  
Also if you use it for any project, please like it on github or something. Always fun to know it was used!
